"""
Opt in to support form cleaning by making async HTTP requests with httpx. 

To define an async per field cleaner:
    async def aclean_field_name(self, async_client):

You can mix async and sync per field cleaners and all will be run.

To define an async form .clean:
    async def aclean(self, async_client):

We have to pass the async_client as a parameter otherwise it will stop working on
subsequent requests as they can't be re-used across event loops and we are still running
under WSGI so have a new async event loop for each request.

You can't have both an async and a sync clean method for a given field or the whole form,
the async one will take precendence.

You can call afull_clean() to run them all asynchronously or use the existing Django
API calling .errors, .is_valid to run them synchronously. The class keeps track of
what has been run so regardless of how you call it, they will only run once.

This class mirrors the internals of ModelForm so could break across versions.
That said, many people override the methods we mirror so they're unlikely to change.
However you should unit test anything using this to ensure it works across updates.
