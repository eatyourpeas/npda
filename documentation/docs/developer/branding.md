## Logos and Branding

The RCPCH Design Team have given us help and advice in ensuring the RCPCH Incubator builds products which adhere to RCPCH Brand Guidance.

In addition they have created custom logos for our projects and even our teams. These logo files are present in the `docs/_assets/_images` folder of [this repository](https://github.com/rcpch/national-paediatric-diabetes-audit/tree/live/documentation/docs/_assets/_images).

## RCPCH Brand Guidance

The RCPCH full brand guidance can be found [here](https://github.com/rcpch/rcpch-private/tree/main/branding-colours) (private repository, access for RCPCH team only)

## Use of TailwindCSS

Note that the NPDA audit uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with custom variables to conform to RCPCH branding.
