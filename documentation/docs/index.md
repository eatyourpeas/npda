## National Paediatric Diabetes Audit

The NPDA collects information on the care and diabetes outcomes of all children and young people receiving care from paediatric diabetes teams in England and Wales, and reports an annual core dataset.

The sole aim is to provide information that leads to an improved quality of care for those children and young people living with diabetes. In addition to our core annual data collection and reporting, we deliver national patient and parent reported experience measures (PREMS), and investigate specific aspects of care and service delivery through spotlight audits.

### Background

The NPDA is an audit of the care processes received and outcomes achieved by all children and young people attending paediatric diabetes units in England and Wales.

It is funded by the Department of Health through the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) and is currently commissioned until 2025.

RCPCH has reinvigorated the paediatric component of the high profile National Diabetes Audit, introducing a number of innovations and efficiencies. These include measures of patient experience and the use of inventive approaches to data collection, which minimise the burden on clinicians.

The RCPCH's Clinical Standards & Quality Improvement team delivers the audit. The audit's Clinical Lead is Dr Justin Warner, Consultant Paediatrician. Local clinical leads support the audit across the country.

The audit is counselled by a Project Board and Methodology & Dataset Working Group, who meet quarterly at the RCPCH. You can download the terms of reference for both below.
